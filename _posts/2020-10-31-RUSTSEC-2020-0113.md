### Description

In the affected versions of this crate,
`AtomicOption<T>` unconditionally implements `Sync`.

This allows programmers to move non-Sync types across thread boundaries (e.g. `Rc<T>`, `Arc<Cell<T>>`), which can lead to data races and undefined behavior. 
It is also possible to send non-Send types like `std::sync::MutexGuard` to other threads, which can lead to undefined behavior.
