### Description

`Shared` data structure in `model` crate implements `Send` and `Sync` traits regardless of the inner type.
This allows safe Rust code to trigger a data race, which is undefined behavior in Rust.

Users are advised to treat `Shared` as an unsafe type.
It should not be used outside of the testing context,
and care must be taken so that the testing code does not have a data race
besides a race condition that is expected to be caught by the test.

Check [the Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/races.html) for the difference between
a data race and a general race condition.
