### Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for `ConVec<T>`.
This allows users to insert `T` that is not Send or not Sync.

This allows users to create data races by using non-Send types like `Arc<Cell<_>>` or `Rc<_>` as `T` in `ConVec<T>`. It is also possible to create data races by using types like `Cell<_>` or `RefCell<_>` as `T` (types that are `Send` but not `Sync`).
Such data races can lead to memory corruption.
