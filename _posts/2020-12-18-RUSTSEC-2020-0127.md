### Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement `Sync` for `SyncRef<T>`.
This definition allows data races if `&T` is accessible through `&SyncRef`.

`SyncRef<T>` derives `Clone` and `Debug`, and the default implementations of those traits access `&T` by invoking `T::clone()` & `T::fmt()`. It is possible to create data races & undefined behavior by concurrently invoking `SyncRef<T>::clone()` or `SyncRef<T>::fmt()` from multiple threads with `T: !Sync`.
