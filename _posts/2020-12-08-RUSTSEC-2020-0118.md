### Description

`tiny_future` contains a light-weight implementation of `Future`s. The `Future`
type it has lacked bound on its `Send` and `Sync` traits.

This allows for a bug where non-thread safe types such as `Cell` can be used in
`Future`s and cause data races in concurrent programs.

The flaw was corrected in commit `c791919` by adding trait bounds to `Future`'s
`Send` and `Sync`.
