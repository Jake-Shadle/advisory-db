description: "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement SendSync for MvccRwLock.

The data races can potentially lead to memory corruption as demonstrated in the PoC from the original report issue.

The APIs of MvccRwLock should either be marked as unsafe or MbccRwLock should be changed to private or pubcrate."

### Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for `MvccRwLock`.
This can lead to data races when types that are either `!Send` or `!Sync` (e.g. `Rc<T>`, `Arc<Cell<_>>`) are contained inside `MvccRwLock` and sent across thread boundaries. The data races can potentially lead to memory corruption (as demonstrated in the PoC from the original report issue).

Also, safe APIs of `MvccRwLock` allow aliasing violations by allowing `&T` and `LockResult<MutexGuard<Box<T>>>` to co-exist in conflicting lifetime regions. The APIs of `MvccRwLock` should either be marked as `unsafe` or `MbccRwLock` should be changed to private or pub(crate).
