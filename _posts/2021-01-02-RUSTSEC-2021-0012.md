### Description

`Deserializer::read_vec()` created an uninitialized buffer and passes it to a user-provided `Read` implementation (`Deserializer.reader.read_exact()`).

Passing an uninitialized buffer to an arbitrary `Read` implementation is currently defined as undefined behavior in Rust. Official documentation for the `Read` trait explains the following: "It is your responsibility to make sure that buf is initialized before calling read. Calling read with an uninitialized buf (of the kind one obtains via MaybeUninit<T>) is not safe, and can lead to undefined behavior."

The flaw was corrected in commit ce310f7 by zero-initializing the newly allocated buffer before handing it to `Deserializer.reader.read_exact()`.
