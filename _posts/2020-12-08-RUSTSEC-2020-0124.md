description: "Affected versions of this crate implement SendSync for ArcGuardRC, T with no trait bounds on RC. This allows users to send RC Send to other threads and also allows users to concurrently access Rc Sync from multiple threads.

### Description

Affected versions of this crate implement Send/Sync for `ArcGuard<RC, T>` with no trait bounds on `RC`. This allows users to send `RC: !Send` to other threads and also allows users to concurrently access `Rc: !Sync` from multiple threads.

This can result in memory corruption from data race or other undefined behavior caused by sending `T: !Send` to other threads (e.g. dropping `MutexGuard<T>` in another thread that didn't lock its mutex).
